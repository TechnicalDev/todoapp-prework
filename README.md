## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1:** "What are your reactions to the Android app development platform so far? Compare and contrast Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces in past platforms you've used."

**Answer:** Android app development is interesting as the app is built native to the OS. I have mostly worked on web based apps and making them responsive to fit in a mobile/tablet layout.
 I am currently looking into developing hybrid apps with ionic and reactive native which is apckaged natively into android.
